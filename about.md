Just your generic linux geek, I like to hack on various projects including the
gentoo repository, coreboot, the linux kernel itself, and odd projects which
need some help with their build scripts to work with mingw-w64.

### More Information

Nothing really special here. I like tinkering with cool embedded devices and
doing what I can to promote the growth of FOSS software in general.
