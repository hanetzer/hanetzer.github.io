Just your generic linux geek, I like to hack on various projects including the
gentoo repository, coreboot, the linux kernel itself, and odd projects which
need some help with their build scripts to work with mingw-w64.

### More Information

Nothing really special here. I like tinkering with cool embedded devices and
doing what I can to promote the growth of FOSS software in general.

### Support my tinkering

Currently, any donations given via btc will go towards the purchase of one of
the Raptor Computing POWER9 systems for use with developing coreboot for (I am
currently using a patched qemu setup with gdb for testing).
